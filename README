This is a module made to get a bit more
exeprience of linux kernel development. 

I have made a server that runs in kernel mode.

You can read the latest incoming message
by the character device driver node created 
as "tcp[PORTNUMBER]". 
Only 64 bytes from incoming messages are 
stored to be able to be read. 

There are some IOCTLs one can use also.

If I find this inspiring to continue working
on I might add IOCTL support for acting as 
a client also.

This is just me exploring the world of Linux
a bit. 

# Install

```bash
# Build the kernel module files
make
# Install the module
sudo make install
```

# Uninstall

```bash
# Uninstall the module
sudo make uninstall
# Remove files not used anymore
make clean
```
